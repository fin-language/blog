# Intro
While I love C, it does have a number of really annoying areas. One of them is integer math.

Fin takes an approach to math similar to Rust, but much less verbose and yet safer.

The main goal is to make it easy to read/write portable and safe fin/C code.

## No Implicit Truncation
If you want to truncate a variable, you have to explicitly do so in fin.

In C, it is perfectly legal to write buggy code like below:

```c
// silent truncation from u32 to u8
uint8_t add(uint32_t a, uint32_t b)
{
  uint32_t result = a * b;
  return result;
}
```

```c
// silent conversion from i32 to u8
void use_u8(uint8_t a)
{
  //...
}

int32_t a = -55555555; // some value that doesn't fit in u8
use_u8(a);
```

You won't get warnings about the above mistakes with `-Wall`, `-Wextra`, or `-Wpedantic`. You have to explicitly enable `-Wconversion` to get a warning.

But as soon as you do that, you get a ton of warnings about perfectly legal code like:

```c
uint8_t b = 0;
b = b + 10; // warning: conversion to â€˜uint8_t from â€˜intâ€™ may alter its value
```

And now we have to put casts absolutely everywhere which I have trouble stomaching... ðŸ¤¢
```c
uint8_t b = 0;
a = (uint8_t)(b + 10); // to avoid annoying warning with -Wconversion
```

Once you start to feel the pain of `-Wconversion`, you can easily undertand why it was left out of `-Wall` and `-Wextra`. It's just too noisy.

With fin, we get safety without excessive warnings and noise.


## More Expressive Operations
C casts are a powerful, yet blunt tool. They can easily hide mistakes because the same syntax is used for many different operations:
* data widening conversions - `(uint32_t)my_u8`
* data narrowing conversions - `(uint8_t)my_u32`
* data narrowing and truncation - `(uint8_t)my_u32`
* imprecise conversions - `(float)my_u32`
* data re-interpretation - `(uint32_t)my_u8_ptr`
* const/volatile conversions
* etc.

When looking at a c-style cast `(uint16_t)my_var`, it is not always apparent at a glance which of the above operations is being invoked. What they all have in common though is telling the compiler:
> _"Trust me compiler! I know what I'm doing. Don't check for errors."_

That may be true at the time of writing and testing the code, but there's nothing in the language to ensure that it stays that way. New programmers inheriting the code, time pressures, refactoring, new features... can easily lead to mistakes where the compiler can't help us because we told it not to.

Most languages ([even C++](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1609163/what-is-the-difference-between-static-cast-and-c-style-casting)) have moved away from c-style casts because they are too broad and "dangerous". Sometimes maintenance programming results in errors where a cast isn't updated correctly. What used to be a widening cast, becomes a narrowing/truncating cast, and now we have a bug.

With `fin`, we have distinct operators that allow us to express our intent. This makes it easier to read and write code that is less susceptible to many issues.


## Safe Mixing Of Signed & Unsigned
Lot's of issues with C here. Common source of bugs.

```c
// C - implementation defined behavior
uint16_t a = 1000;
int16_t b = -1;
bool a_is_greater = a > b; // ??? need to know int size
```

Fin solves this completely. More below.

## No Implicit Promotion To `int`
C implicitly promotes smaller integer types to `int` when performing arithmetic operations or comparisons. This makes it difficult to write portable/consistent code as you have to always be thinking about the potential size of `int` (16/32/64 bit). See STM32/AVR example below.

In `fin`, you can easily and safely widen to a larger type.


<br>
<br>


# Tiny Example
Here's a small function that multiplies two numbers, and divides by 1024. This code may not behave consistently cross platform. It sure looks like it should, but it doesn't because of the implicit promotion to `int`.

```c
// c99 - non-portable
uint16_t calc_1(uint16_t a, uint16_t b)
{
  return a * b / 1024;
}
```

This is the basic test code we will run on each platform:

```cpp
// c99 test code
uint16_t a = 1000;
uint16_t b = 2000;
uint16_t result = calc_1(a, b);
```

If you do this math with a calculator, you'll get `1953.125` so we should be expecting `1953` due to integer division.

On an STM32, the result is `1953` as expected. On the AVR, the result is `33` because it has a 16 bit int which overflows.

To fix this, we explicitly convert `a` (and/or `b`) to u32 before doing the math. We should also cast the result back down to u16 to make it clear that we are truncating the result and avoid compiler warnings.

```c
// c99 - fixed
uint16_t calc_7(uint16_t a, uint16_t b)
{
  return (uint16_t)((uint32_t)a * b / 1024);
  // what is the intent of the `(uint16_t)` cast though?
}
```

But... is the `(uint16_t)` cast to avoid a compiler warning because truncation should never happen?

Or is the truncation/wrapping behavior desired? It needs a comment to explain.

## `Fin` Solution
The below `fin` code is equivalent to the fixed C99 code above. Later sections explain this code, but just take a quick peek for now. It's pretty easy to understand what is going on.

```cs
// fin
u16 calc_7(u16 a, u16 b)
{
  return (a.u32 * b / 1024).unsafe_to_u16();
  // "Unsafe" narrowing conversion tells the reader that truncation should never happen.
  // If truncation happens during C# simulation, an exception is thrown. More below.
}
```

# `Fin` Specification

## Safe Widening Operators
It is safe to widen to larger types so fin provides succinct properties (`u16 a` example):
* `a.u32` - safe widening to `u32`. Generates to `(uint32_t)a` in C.
* `a.u64` - safe widening to `u64`. Generates to `(uint64_t)a` in C.
* `a.i32` - safe widening to `i32`. Generates to `(int32_t)a` in C.
* `a.i64` - safe widening to `i64`. Generates to `(int64_t)a` in C.
* `a.f32` - safe widening to `f32`. Generates to `(float)a` in C.
* `a.f64` - safe widening to `f64`. Generates to `(double)a` in C.
* ...

Note that `u16` types do <u>NOT</u> have `a.u8`, `a.u16`, `a.i8`, `a.i16` because those are not safe widening operations.

## Explicit Saturation
Values can be converted to smaller types in a saturating manner with a number of methods (`u16 a` example):
* `a.sat_u8()`  - converts to `u8` clamping to limits. Function call in C.
* `a.sat_i8()`  - converts to `i8` clamping to limits. Function call in C.
* `a.sat_i16()` - converts to `i16` clamping to limits. Function call in C.

## Explicit Wrapping/Truncation
Unsigned values can be explicitly wrapped/truncated to smaller types with a number of methods  (`u16 a` example):
* `a.wrap_u8()` - wraps/truncates to `u8`. Generates to `(uint8_t)a` in C.

> Note: we will not have wrap functions for signed integers because that is undefined or implementation defined behavior in C. We usually want modulo/wrapping behavior for unsigned values. I can't think of when I would want that with signed values at the time of writing this. If there are good use cases, we can add them.

## Checked Narrowing
These methods narrow to smaller data types, but they also check for overflow. If the value is too large, they set the `err` parameter to `true`. These methods generate to C function calls. The `err` parameter is only set on overflow (it is not cleared on success).

```cs
// fin
Err err = // stack allocated error object
u16 a = 256 + 1;
u8 b = a.to_u8(err);
// b == 1, err.is_active == true

err.clear();
b = (a.u32 * b / 1024).to_u16(err);
```

Why take an `Err` object as a parameter instead of returning a bool? Lots of reasons (allows chaining and combining, easy to read, ...). That said, we will likely eventually add another style for operations that return a `bool` instead of using an `Err` object:
```cs
// fin
u16 a = 256 + 1;
u8 b;
bool success = a.to_u8(out b);
// b == 1, success == false

success = (a.u32 * b / 1024).to_u16(out b); // I don't like this one much
// maybe we do it the opposite way like C23 (bool true means overflow).
```

## Unsafe Fast Narrowing
We will also add something like `a.unsafe_to_u8()` which generates to `(uint8_t)a` in C.

These methods check for overflow in fin/C# simulation/tests, but the generated C code does not. This is useful if size or performance is a concern.

## Safe Implicit Widening
In the below code, we don't need to do `b.u32` because it is automatically widened to match `a.u32` before the multiplication.

```cs
// fin
u16 calc_7(u16 a, u16 b)
{
  return (a.u32 * b / 1024).wrap_u16();
}
```
Rust takes a different approach and requires explicit widening for all operands:

```rust
// rust
fn calc_7(a: u16, b: u16) -> u16
{
  return (u32::from(a) * u32::from(b) / 1024) as u16;
}
```

We can add a `fin` option to require explicit widening if desired.


## Mixing Signed & Unsigned
Fin takes a sane approach to mixing signed and unsigned types. It is safe to mix signed and unsigned types in arithmetic operations. The result is always a type that is large enough to hold both operands.

```c
// C - implementation defined behavior
uint16_t a = 1000;
int16_t b = -1;
bool a_is_greater = a > b; // ??? need to know int size
```

  ```

Math conversions:
```c
u8 + i8  -> i16   // i16 can hold all of u8 and i8
u8 + i16 -> i16   // i16 can hold all of u8
... 
u16 + i8  -> i32  // i32 can hold all of u16 and i8
u16 + i16 -> i32  // i32 can hold all of u16 and i16
u16 + i32 -> i32  // i32 can hold all of u16
...
```

## Overflow, Divide By Zero Detection
You can chain math calls together. If any overflow or divide by zero occurs, the `Err` object will be set.

```c
// fin
u8 calc_stuff(u8 a, u8 b, u8 c, Err err)
{
  return a.add(b, err).div(c, err);
}
```


## Best Of Both Worlds
In the nearish future, we will also be able to write something like the below code which is equivalent to `a.add(b, err).div(c, err)` code. This allows even more natural mathematical expressions, but also captures errors.

```cs
// fin
u8 calc_stuff(u8 a, u8 b, u8 c, Err err)
{
  Math.capture_errors(err);
  return (a + b) / c;
}
```

<br>
<br>

# Near Future Error Handling
In the future, math will be safe by default. If you want to ignore potential errors for speed or code size, you will need to explicitly do so.

## Explicit Ignoring
```cs
// fin
u8 calc_stuff(u16 a, u16 b, u16 c)
{
  Math.unsafe_mode(); // ignore `a+b` overflow, divide by zero, return truncation
  return ((a + b) / c).unsafe_to_u8();
}
```

## Super Explicit Handling
Not recommended or supported initially.
```cs
// fin
u8 calc_stuff(u16 a, u16 b, u16 c, Err err)
{
  return a.add(b, err).div(c, err).to_u8();
}
```


## Explicit Handling (Natural Syntax)
```cs
// fin
u8 calc_stuff(u16 a, u16 b, u16 c, Err err)
{
  Math.capture_errors(err); // capture `a+b` overflow, divide by zero, to_u8() error
  return ((a + b) / c).to_u8();
}
```

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>


# Math Code Generation Options...
Given the below fin code, what should the generated C code look like?

```cs
// fin
u16 calc(u16 a, u16 b)
{
  return (a.u32 * b / 1024).wrap_u16();
}
```

## C99 - casts
Casts everywhere to ensure portability regardless of int size.

```c
// Generated C99 - casts
uint16_t calc(uint16_t a, uint16_t b)
{
  // fin: (a.u32 * b / 1024).wrap_u16();
  return (uint16_t)((uint32_t)((uint32_t)((uint32_t)a * (uint32_t)b) / 1024) );
  // Note: we could eventually be smarter and remove some casts above.
}
```

Pros:
- No function call overhead

Cons:
- Lots of casts, hard to read.

## C99 - inline functions

```c
// Generated C99 - inline functions
uint16_t calc(uint16_t a, uint16_t b)
{
  // fin: (a.u32 * b / 1024).wrap_u16();
  return wrap_u32_to_u16( div_u32( mult_u32(a, b), 1024 ) );
}

// in another header file...
static inline uint32_t mult_u32(uint32_t a, uint32_t b) { /*...*/ }
static inline uint32_t div_u32(uint32_t a, uint32_t b) { /*...*/ }
static inline uint16_t wrap_u32_to_u16(uint32_t a) { /*...*/ }
```

```c
// Generated C99 - inline functions

//fin: a.add(b, err).div(c, err);
u8_checked_div( u8_checked_add(a, b, err), c, err);
```

Pros:
- easy to read

Cons:
- function cost in debug builds (although none when optimizations are enabled)
- will need some way of ensuring function names don't clash with user code



## C99 - hand inlined functions
Pros:
- very easy to debug and follow
- great for code coverage (if all branches are reachable)

Cons:
- harder to implement
- large code size

Pseudo code:
```c
//fin: a.add(b, err).div(c, err);
uint8_t temp = a + b; // allow roll over
if (temp < a)
{
	if (err.code == NO_ERR)
		// overflow
		err.code = OVERFLOW;
}
else
{
	if (c == 0 && err.code == NO_ERR)
	{
		err.code = DIV_BY_ZERO;
	}
	else
	{
		temp /= c;
	}
}
```


## Decision
Start with whichever is easier to implement. Not bad either way with `fin: ` comment above.
